This iteration visualizes the connective dynamics of memory through a shifting red network. These lines weave connections between the activated musical fragments, hinting at the emergence of mnemonic patterns. The poetry of the network lies in how it frames memory as a dynamic field of potentials, where remembering is an act of construction. Visually, the lines group elements that appear close together or that share similar trajectories, suggesting how coherence can arise from scattered memories. In this way, the network not only connects points, but also represents the process of forming constellations of meaning from fragments.</p>
