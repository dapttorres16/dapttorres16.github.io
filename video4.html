This final iteration sets up a critical dialogue between structure and dissolution. Visually, it brings together the connective network from Iteration 2 with the unstable base from Iteration 3. The poetry of the lines is found in their effort to trace connections over a dynamically corrupted staff, embodying the mnemonic process as a reconstructive act in a hostile environment. The dialectical tension between the networkâ€™s drive to connect and the fragility of the support reveals memory not as something recoverable, but as a performative act of ongoing negotiation with loss.</p>
