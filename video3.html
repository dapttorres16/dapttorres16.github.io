In this phase, the material contingency of the sound archive comes to the fore. The abstract staff that appears is shaped directly by the inherent noise of the original audio. Its lines show a dynamic instability: their continuity and visibility change depending on the qualities of the noise in the sound samples.

Its intermittent, fragmented appearance challenges perception, forcing the viewer to confront the fragility of inscription and the role of disintegration as an integral part of the visual analysis.</p>
