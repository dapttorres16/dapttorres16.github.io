            <p>Iteration 1
This first experiment brings out the fragmented quality of the recovered sound. The automaton’s reaction appears as a single, isolated note head set against the backdrop of Mozart’s original score, though now marked by visual noise reacting to the noise of the recovered fragments. This sharp visual contrast draws attention to each note as a punctual and mediated echo of the past(the recovered audio file). The visualization intention is to highlight the tension between the integrity of the historical reference—the complete score—and the fragmentary character of its digital reenactment. By isolating the touch as a single event, this iteration focuses on the mediated and incomplete process of retrieving sound from a damaged archive.</p>
